Synthea Mass Opiod Project

Dallas Py-R Project - Public Market Team

This project is designed to show how the IBM Watson suite of technologies can provide value in a practical way for data science applications. This application will analyze and apply data science methods to identify the factors that contribute to opiod abuse. 
The data for this Application is based on Synthea or the Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. (https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea) More specifically we are using the synthetic data set built by Mitre called  SyntheticMass (https://synthea.mitre.org/about) - which is a dataset containing realistic but fictional residents of Massachusetts. This application uses several IBM Cloud cognitive and data services with Watson Studio at the core of the workload flow. The application will deploy a model into the IBM Cloud using Watson. Monitoring & management is accomplished using IBM's OpenScale.

Getting Started

The following documentation will discuss the details of how this project was deployed and the benefits of the various technologies used.

Prerequisites

The only tangible prerequisite for this project is a IBM Cloud account. For successful deployment, it is also important to have an understanding of IBM's cloud technologies.

An IBM Cloud account can be obtained here
